# Truphone---Technical-Coding-Challenge

## Truphone Tech Assessment | Backend Software Engineer - RSP

In order to organise my code I tried to follow the SOLID principles of JAVA for object-oriented architectures. Let me break my code down for you very briefly:

1. **Controller Layer/AP Layer** - This layer job is simply to receive and handle HTTP (*GET, POST, PUT, DELETE*) requests sent by clients. When an HTTP request is received this layer must forward the request to the service layer.

2. **Service Layer** - This layer handles the business logic/the rules for this application. In this case, implements the list of operations required with all the validations included and forward the request to the Data Access layer.

3. **Data Access Layer** - The main purpose of this layer is to contain logic that performs CRUD (Create Read, Update, Delete) operations against the data repository/database.
For example receive a device from the service layer and insert into the database/repository. 

**Note:** For this challenge and to represent a DB, I used a Java Collection - HashMap to store my devices information. Inside the constructor there is a private method called *init()* that creates a few dummy devices for tests purpose.


Here's a diagram to help:

In this GIT repo, you may find the project folder within the source code application and a Postman collection with all the operations/requests pre-set to be used.

**Missing/Future actions:**
- Implement tests
- Connect the Data Access Layer to a real DB
- Implement the PUT request with request body and returning the object updated
- Return JSON responses when a Device is created/deleted/updated
- Improve code and variables naming

**To Build the Maven project:**
Go to the mvn project folder and run the command: mvn package

This command will compile the code and package it as a JAR.

**To run the JAR:**
You may test the compiled and packaged JAR with the command: java -jar target/technical-challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
